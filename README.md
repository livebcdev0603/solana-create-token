## Overview

Here are the steps for creating a new Solana fungible token using command-line tools and scripts.

Also manage tokens safely across a team using a multisig wallet approach instead of a single owner.

The example token created here is called `BUOY` and the final version exists live on Solana at [7uVii1LGC5jCJAgHHmLqKZP3bpNtJS6ywHW6CUSocuyD](https://explorer.solana.com/address/7uVii1LGC5jCJAgHHmLqKZP3bpNtJS6ywHW6CUSocuyD).
